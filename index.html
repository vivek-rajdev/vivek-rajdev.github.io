                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-5 display-4">I created and piloted a standardized impact evaluation framework that measures community engagement and health outcomes for adolescent-led Our Voice (OV) projects, using case studies from around the world. I authored and defended my master’s-level thesis on the framework before a panel of Stanford professors, data scientists, and epidemiologists, and the tool is now being implemented across 4,000+ nonprofits globally. I also led a conservation-focused pilot project adapting the OV methodology for national scouting integration, and my findings will appear in a forthcoming Springer Nature Press book (2025), currently under peer review.<br><br></p>

                                    <strong>Speech and Debate</strong></h5>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-5 display-4">As founder, president, and coach of my school’s Speech and Debate team, I built the program from the ground up—growing it from just 4 students to over 35 (nearly 20% of our school), raising $13,000+ in funding, and coaching teammates to over 20 tournament wins and national-level recognition. I’ve ranked among the top speakers nationally, including placing 11th in Impromptu at the 2024 National Individual Events Tournament of Champions and earning top placements in Extemporaneous Speaking and World Schools Debate at NSDA Nationals, the Tournament of Champions, and NCFL Nationals. I was part of one of only four teams to receive a perfect seed at NSDA Nationals, and the only team to defeat the eventual champions, Team China Gold. Beyond competition, I led initiatives to promote public speaking across campus—organizing school-wide events and designing curriculum to teach rhetorical and argumentative skills. I also helped secure a university-level coach for the team to further institutionalize the program. Most recently, I became the first high school student selected to serve as a Lab Assistant for the Harvard Debate Council Summer Workshops, where I worked alongside college faculty to teach public speaking and argumentation, coached students to finals, judged in-person tournament rounds, and received formal commendation from the program's leadership.<br><br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-5 display-4">Over the past three years, I’ve led the creation and growth of the Khan Lab School Student Life Center as part of a multi-year for-credit Cornerstone project. The Center now serves as a vital student-led hub on campus, encompassing two key services: the Khanvenience Store and the Tutoring Center. I co-founded the Store in 2021 as part of my first-year Cornerstone, designing and launching a fully student-run system that has since expanded into a popular on-campus retail space. In 2024, I launched the Tutoring Center through my final Cornerstone, formalizing academic support systems for peers across disciplines—especially in college-level math, science, and humanities courses. The Tutoring Center now offers peer-led review sessions, and is actively expanding to support AP coursework, standardized test prep, and more, all rooted in the peer-to-peer learning ethos that defines KLS.</p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-5 display-4">I’ve been involved in Scouting since first grade and currently serve as a Life Scout and two-time Senior Patrol Leader of Troop 447, one of Fremont’s oldest and most established troops. Being elected SPL twice—an uncommon honor in our troop—reflects the leadership and trust I’ve built over years of service. I’ve doubled recruitment, expanded troop engagement, and organized key events including annual calendars, campouts, service projects, and fundraisers like our pancake breakfast, which raised over $4,500. I’ve also signed off on over 100 advancement requirements and mentored younger Scouts in core skills like first aid, navigation, cooking, and community responsibility. In Summer 2024, I was one of the few Scouts invited to serve as a Counselor-in-Training at Camp Royaneh, the oldest Boy Scout camp west of the Mississippi, where I worked on the Nature team teaching conservation and environmental ethics. I’m now completing my final requirements for Eagle.</p>
